# Proposal: Design System Specification

## Why
We need to codify the "Ethereal Nebula" design language to ensure visual consistency and developer efficiency. A central specification will serve as the source of truth for all frontend implementations.

## What Changes
- **NEW**: `doc/design_system_spec.md` - comprehensive design system documentation.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `design-doc`: Defines the content and structure of the Design System Specification.

## Impact
- **Documentation**: New key artifact in `doc/`.
- **Code**: No code changes.
