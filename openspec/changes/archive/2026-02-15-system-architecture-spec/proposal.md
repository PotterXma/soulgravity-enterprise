# Proposal: System Architecture Specification

## Why
We have completed the Phase 3 architectural design for the "Lingxi · SoulGravity Enterprise" middleware. To ensure long-term maintainability and provide a single source of truth for the team, we need a comprehensive **System Architecture Specification**.
This document will serve as the "Constituion" for the project, detailing the design philosophy, module boundaries, and extension patterns.

- **NEW**: `doc/architecture_spec.md` - A comprehensive architecture specification.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `architecture-doc`: Defines the content and structure of the System Architecture Specification.
